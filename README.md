# 2.1gdps-script

This script is intended to be used to obtain a legitimate copy of Geometry Dash 2.1 and modify it to point to the official Pointercrate approved GDPS. <br>
Currently, this script only supports Windows. MacOS is unsupported at this time. <br>
Linux likely works running this script thru WINE, but results may vary until a native Linux port is released. <br>

At the moment, this script requires you to provide the path to the installer. This will likely be changed in the future as the script will be able to automatically download the required files directly from steam. <br>
