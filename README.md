# 2.1gdps-script

This script is intended to be used to obtain a legitimate copy of Geometry Dash 2.1 and modify it to point to the official Pointercrate approved GDPS. <br>
Currently, this script only supports Windows. MacOS is unsupported at this time. <br>
Linux likely works running this script thru WINE, but results may vary until a native Linux port is released. <br>
